Refactor: Update image paths and Tailwind CSS integration

- Corrected image paths in various .astro files to use root-relative paths.
- Removed CDN link for Tailwind CSS from all .astro files.
- Created `tailwind.config.cjs` for proper Tailwind CSS integration.
- Updated `global.css` to use `@tailwind` directives.
