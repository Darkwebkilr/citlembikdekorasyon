Fix: Update image paths in index.astro to direct public folder references

- Replaced `src={imgX}` with direct paths like `src="/image/X.webp"`.
- Updated `background-image` styles to use direct paths for local images.
- Kept external URLs for hero background and first customer review image as requested.
